## House Recommendation System Using Machine Learning 
House finding for rent can be a daunting task, especially in metropolitan areas where numerous options are available. A recommendation system can ease this process by filtering properties based on user preferences and providing relevant suggestions. 

### Objective
The main objective addressed by this project is to solve the difficulty users face in finding rental properties that meet their specific needs and preferences in a large and diverse available rental options. 

The recommendation system is made using the various techniques of machine learning. “Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.”
